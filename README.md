### How to use
1. Run either:
   * `falcon-briefing.py` with Python
   * use the precompiled executable â€” [see #Download](#Download)
2. Click the "Print" button when you are viewing a briefing inside Falcon BMS
3. Open the address shown in the `falcon-briefing.py` window (Example: `http://192.168.1.100:8000/current-briefing.html`)
with your smartphone's browser.

For it to work, you have to enable the "Briefing Output to File" and
"HTML Briefings" options in Falcon BMS.

### Dependencies
* Python 3
* [Watchgod (Python module)](https://github.com/samuelcolvin/watchgod)

### Tip for Usage

I compiled the script into a single-file executable for use on Windows
using [PyInstaller](https://www.pyinstaller.org/). I placed the file somewhere
on my disk and automatically start it whenever I open Falcon BMS. After that, I
created a shortcut to open the briefing on my smartphone's home screen.

That way all I ever have to do is start Falcon BMS, click on the "Print"
when I view the briefing and click on the icon on my smartphone's home screen.

### Download
You can find a compiled EXE for Windows in the [Releases](https://github.com/dglava/falcon-briefing/releases).
If you want to compile your own (see the notice below for a reason why),
you can use [PyInstaller](https://www.pyinstaller.org/).

**Notice: PyInstaller compiled Windows executables are sometimes falsely
tagged as malware by various malware tools. See [this](https://github.com/pyinstaller/pyinstaller/issues?q=is%3Aissue+virus+is%3Aclosed),
